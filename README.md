# Overview
This repository contains data and maps visualizing the regional prevalence of early childhood vulnerability across Australia. The maps are generated based on models developed to understand how socioeconomic and remoteness indicators affect childhood vulnerability [@baffour2024utility].

# Contents
- **Input Folder**: Contains the data files used for generating the maps.
  - **Data**: `data_AEDC.csv`
  - **Maps provided by ABS under ASGS2016**: `ASGS16`
- **Output Folder**: Contains a series of maps showing the distribution of early childhood vulnerability by various indicators, as well as the proportion of indigenious people:
  - **Health Vulnerability**: [`Map_Health.png`](./Output/Map_Health.png)
  - **Social Vulnerability**: [`Map_Social.png`](./Output/Map_Social.png)
  - **Emotional Vulnerability**: [`Map_Emotional.png`](./Output/Map_Emotional.png)
  - **Language Vulnerability**: [`Map_Language.png`](./Output/Map_Language.png)
  - **Communication Vulnerability**: [`Map_Communication.png`](./Output/Map_Social.png)
  - **Indigenous Population Vulnerability**: [`Map_Indigenous.png`](./Output/Map_Indigenous.png)

# Purpose
These resources provide a visual representation of early childhood vulnerability across different regions in NSW in Australia. The maps highlight areas where children are most vulnerable, helping researchers and policymakers focus their efforts on regions that need the most support.

# Usage
1. **View the maps**: The maps included in this repository can be directly viewed to assess regional disparities in various aspects of childhood vulnerability.
2. **Data**: The `Input` folder contains the data files used in the creation of these maps, which can be utilized for further analysis or to reproduce similar maps.
